# Forum Moderation Rewards

## Project Title
Forum Moderation Rewards

## Project Description
The Forum Moderation Rewards contract is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows forum administrators or creators to assign tasks to moderators and distribute rewards upon task completion. Moderators can earn tokens for performing moderation tasks, such as reviewing content or handling disputes, once the task is completed. The contract ensures fair distribution of rewards to moderators, allowing them to claim their earnings.

This smart contract is designed to incentivize good behavior, create transparent reward systems, and provide a decentralized approach to forum management.
